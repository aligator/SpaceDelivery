[Ludum Dare 53 game](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53/space-delivery-1)

A big shower of asteroids destroyed the moon base.
You have the order to bring much needed stuff to the moon.

However - there are still the asteroids on your way to it…

Controls: Arrow keys

Spoiler:
There is no moon…

It is not exactly what I planned to do^^

Game mechanics:

    the higher you get, the less gravity - (up to some point)
    the slower you are, the less power you need 

No it does not make any sense.
